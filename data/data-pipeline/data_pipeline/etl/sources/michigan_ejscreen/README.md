# Michigan EJSCREEN

The Michigan EJSCREEN description and publication can be found [here](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/149105/AssessingtheStateofEnvironmentalJusticeinMichigan_344.pdf).


#### Some notes about the input source data:

1. There are two pertinent columns used - `EJ_Score_Cal_Min` and `Pct_CalMin`.
2. The "Cal" prefix reflects California's methodology omitting racial and ethnic data and the "Min" (please see page 37 - 39 in the above reference) prefix reflects Minnesota's approach to including this data.

The scores and percentile rankings for those columns in the updated sheet are the same as those reflected in the cited report (above), including Appendix I.

Please see pages 104 -106 for details on the justification and details for the applicability of of the upper quartile as a means to identify communities in Michigan with the potential for environmental justice concerns. It should also be noted that, according to the authors, that CalEPA also designates the top 25% scoring tracts as â€œdisadvantaged communities".
