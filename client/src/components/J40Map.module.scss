      This width is set to prevent this row from 
      overflowing. Using justify-content: space-between
      will allow the geolocation button to be right 
      ajusted. Without the width property constraint
      of 98%, the space-between property forces the
      geolocation icon out of the parent container.
      
      Since the geolocation control is absolutely
      positioned, attempts were made to set the 
      parent to be relative to avoid this, however
      it seems that we haven't found a cleaner
      solution (yet).
